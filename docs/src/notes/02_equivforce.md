# Equivalent nodal force

This section examines the equivalent nodal force due to excavation in 3D model. 

## Equivalent nodal force due to excavation in 1D (theory)


## Full 3D nodal force due to excavation

**Confirmed that for the excavation on the tetrahedron elements, the equivalent nodal force in the x- and y- directions are not the same. The figures are saved in the /docs/ directory (2024-09-14).** 

The test needs to add components to the mesh, and increase the task for reading the new components, thus not integrated into the code. 

But the 1D theoretical example on how to obtain the equivalent nodal forces due to excavation worth to show in the Notes for me to remember it.
